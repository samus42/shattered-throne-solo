# What you need
Still with me? Good, here are things you're going to need:
* Whisper of the Worm - If you don't have it, then stop.  Just stop.  I did it without the catalyst, but **really** wish I had gotten it first.
* To have run this before as a fireteam.  This isn't a step by step walkthrough, I'm going to assume you know what the different encounters are, and how to traverse between them.  More importantly I'm assuming you know where this mission **is**.
* Some Trandscendant Blessings and some armor you're willing to use it on.
* A set of void weapons you like.
* A knowledge of left vs right.
* A schedule that allows you to put in a couple of hours a day during Curse Week.  Trying to do this all at once is not good for your mental health.
* Someone who loves you nearby that will tell you it's all ok.  It's not, they're lying, but it's nice to hear.
* A space where you can curse.  Often and loudly.
* Snacks.  There will be stress eating.
* Your alcohol locked up.  Trust me on this, nothing good will come from having liquor handy here.
* Blessings of your priest, rabbi, imam, whatever.  Bonus points if you explain what its for.
* Extreme stubborness.
* Heavy Ammo Finder & Special Ammo Finder.  And if possible the Please Drop Either But Please Not Primary Ammo Finder.

**Note** you do not need to complete this in one day.  There are checkpoints where you can come back to if you leave.  Dying is ok too (because it's going to happen a lot).
