# Part 5 - End of the Road
Do you have your Whisper?  Go ahead and equip it now.  You might want to just leave and fill up your power ammo.

While you're out, start making whatever offerings to whatever gods/godesses you worship.  This part goes beyond brutal, it's basically unfair.  The only good news is each run won't take you too long.

Hopefully it's Friday/Saturday, so you have a couple of days to conquer this.  

## Loadout
Whisper Whisper Whisper.  Not only for the damage, but for the fact if you land 3 hits you get 3 shots back.  Ammo is *not* plentiful here.  You'll also want something that can kill the Taken Psions quickly.  For me it was this:
* Primary: Tigerspite
* Special: Tatara Gaze
* Power: Whisper of the Worm

That's right, I have **two** sniper rifles equipped.  No I'm not crazy.  Well not completely...

## Subclasses
For a Warlock, I have to recommend the Well.  It will give you the most time in the damage phase, and prevent the reloads if you miss.  Rifts can be very useful here as well.  

Titans, either stick with Hammers or go for broke with Thundercrash on the boss.  Doing the slams might be a good way to finish off the Knights as well.  

Hunters, it depends on how well you think you can clear the adds.  For straight damage, putting on a Celestial Nighthawk and Golden Gun can demolish the boss if you have 3x multiplier.  However you have to live that long.  I ran tether for add control, but it had an extra benefit I discovered...

## Kicking it off
Start off with a Whisper round in the head of each Knight, from left to right.  They're easy shots so you should get your ammo back.  Immediately then go to either the right or left alcove and greande the hell out of the adds.  Choose a grenade that hit a lot at once.  Again, Titans have the easy life with the option to do double pulse grenades. 

Yes, I'm bitter.

At this point, the boss will start firing at you, and the Knights will approach.  The Taken Psions from the other side will want your attention too as then open up on you (as well as starting their ultra fast breeding program).  If you have a 2nd grenade (still bitter), you can take them out.  Otherwise you'll need to wipe them out the old fashioned way.  A tether can also help here, with a little extra benefit that I am definitely getting to.

If you have decent Whisper ammo start hammering the Knights with headshots, spreading out the damage as much as possible.  Be aware that the Knights will disappear at time, and you'll have to find another target quick if you want the ammo refill.  This is why I have a 2nd sniper rifle (plus that little extra tether trick I am getting to).  If you hang back in the balcony, they usually will not persue you.  **Usually**.

Now you've got a choice, and its a tough one.  You can either go for the kill and eliminate the Knights, or wait another round so you have more time.  It's a poor choice as your best chance of finishing this is in the first round.  However if you don't get the knights killed before the crystal appears, then you'll only get part of the multiplier as the Knights stalk you.  Or worse case, you'll have an invincible Knight without it's helmet stalking you who will give you no chance to do any damage.  In fact, you're pretty much screwed at that point.

## A note on the online vidoes (again)
Bullshit.  It's bullshit.  In the all the videos I saw, the knights stayed together in a nice straight line, allowing the shooter to just plink away.  That never happened for me.  After the adds went down they split up, they bounced up and down the stairs making headshots difficult, and they blinked out of existance as I took my shot.  Oh, and the Wizard hardly shot at them.

@#$@ you YouTuber.

## Assuming you decided to wait a round
This seems like a smart choice, after all your grenade is back, and with the right equipment, your super probably is too.  So just rinse and repeat.  

Only one problem, there is a good chance the boss is going to move when the round resets.  And if the boss moves to your side, you'll be dead before you realize it's there.  It's completely unfair, but that's the theme of this fight.

If the boss goes to the other side, there is pretty much no cover.  The boss will fire around and over the pedestal in the middle.  So you'll be taking care of the Knights and the other adds out in open as you try to use a pillar to get some cover.  Titan walls can save you here.  Because god forbid Titan's suffer.

You might think about going behind the pillars where the boss started.  The Knights will follow you back there, but it can give you some breathing room.

It's reasonable here to decide to go for a 3rd round, and hope the Wizard goes back to its original position.

## Taking down the Knights
At this point you have the Knights weak enough, that you're going to blast their helmets off.  If you still have a lot of Whisper ammo left, go ahead and finish them with that.  However if the Knight is in a position where they're going to be bouncing down stairs, might think about finishing them off with another weapon to save ammo.

You need them to all go down fast, the orb won't stay there forever, and as soon as you pick one up, the timer starts.

Bad news is sometimes a Knight will disappear after you take down the others, and won't reappear for a while.  Which means you'll have to do a damage round with a 2x multiplier.  You probably won't finish off the boss with that, meaning you start the whole process over again.  Though one Knight will be mostly weak.  *Woo*.

## Boss DPS Time
You hopefully have 3x multiplier at this point, and at least 5 shots left in your Whisper.  You don't have a lot of time, but you need to make sure each shot counts.  If you miss a critical when you started with 5 shots, reload immediately so you can keep a clip with 3 shots it in.  If you finish off your clip that started with 5 shots with with a missed critical you no longer will have endless shots.  Try to group your shots in 3, but if you take a 4th, you can duck behind a pillar for a second, then pop back out to get the other 2 hits to keep the chain going.  

Missing 2 crits means you probably will not finish this.  Though you will be close.  Annoyingly, painfully close.  Throw your controller across the room close (note to self, buy new controller).  

Learning how many hits you can take from the boss before healing can really help your time management.

## A note on tethers
At first glance, a tether here has a couple of disadvantages.  Yes it can take care of all the Psions, but it also causes the Knights to disappear after a second.  It also means that if you have a Knight that's weak, and the others that aren't, you're guaranteed to get that weak Knight in the tether, possibly causing it to lose it's helmet, or die prematurely.

So it seems that tether is not the way to go here...

And yet...

If you're good at balancing the damage, you can eliminate the Knights at once.  And that can be very very useful.

But there is one more trick, one I have subtly been hinting at.  And it deals with the shared damage, the Psions, and the fact that the Knights disappear after a second.

But you have that second.  And if you're me, you have that 2nd sniper rifle.

What I found was if your tether gets all those Psions close together with the Knights, and as soon as you tether you switch to the sniper rifle and spam shots on one of the Knights, there is a huge damage feedback explosion as they disappear.  

And 3 orbs from the eliminated Knights on the ground.

I was able to get this to happen a couple of times once I realized how it worked.  This isn't the way I won.  Though it was very very close. I won by going two rounds and the gods accepting my sacrifice of:
* 10 Oreo Cookies
* A bottle of Scotch
* Virgin's Blood (my son never felt the needle)
* A piece macaroni artwork

Which kept the boss from rotating after the first round.  I did use the tether to share the damage for the 3 weakened Knights to take them out.

## In the end
Take screenshots.  Take screenshots of you doing emotes.  Take a selfie with a newspaper so you know the date you completed this.  Then start telling everyone.  Wake up your wife.  Make sure your boss at work knows.  Turn the screenshots into your desktop background.  In fact make it the background of your phone, your wife's phone, your kid's phone, and your boss's phone.

Honestly, your boss should have picked a better PIN.

And promise yourself.  Really promise yourself.

Never, *ever* do this again.
