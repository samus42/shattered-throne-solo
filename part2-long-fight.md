# Part 2 - The Looooong Fight
Actually, what it should be called is *Please God Drop Some Sniper Ammo*, but that's a mouthful.

## STOP - Take a break!
Hopefully it's still Tuesday.  But after the last slog, you need to take a break for your mental health.  Especially since at this point you've been lulled into a false sense of security.  The last section was slow, but if done cautiously, not too bad.  So you might think it's going to be ok.  So let me reiterate.

**It is not going to be ok**

So take a break.  If you have time every day this week, you might just want to stop here for today.  But if not, you should probably try at least a couple runs of this next area after a nice relaxing nap.

Go ahead, I'll wait....

## Go time!
FYI, you snore.

For your loadout, you want as much long range as you can get.  There's only one small area where you'll be within mid-range. A sniper rifle is a must, key up a super that can lay waste to an area (Titans, you've got plenty of choices here).  A scout rifle is good for when you run out of sniper ammo (see above).  Not much in the way of shields here, so choose what element type you like.  A rocket launcher as a heavy isn't a terrible idea if you're the impatient type.

## The first drop
Make sure you drop on that first rock outcropping on the left, then shoot the invisible Taken Minotaur from up top.  Feel free to potshot the other Taken as well, but they're slightly easier to hit once you drop down after eliminating the invisible Minotaur.

Immediately pull out your sniper rifle and shift to the left.  Take out everyone you can see, yes including the Taken Paperboy.  He knew the risks.  There will be some Taken that will shield, so you'll have to wait them out.  There's also another invisible guy up there, so try to take it out as well.

## Hallway to the staircase
Look carefully at all the rocks and alcoves here, you'll going to make use of it.  Make your way up the staircase then IMMEDIATELY turn right and start shooting.  There is a Centurion there.  

Do not rest on your laurels after killing it.  At this point all the baddies above you have woken up, and will probably start shooting at you from up above.

If you're feeling brave, and have say, a Hammer Super.  Sprint up the stairs and start laying waste.  You might actually survive.  

For the rest of us, there are Taken Minotaurs that will start spamming fire on you, and a Taken Captian that will hurl it's black ball of death like it has an infinite amount.  And everyone warps around.

### Side note
Where the hell are they getting all the energy for this?  Frankly for the amount of fire they rained down on me, they should have drained the Ascendant Realm dry.  We should look at way to capture some of these guys, and have them power parts of the city.

## Constructive Cowardice
You might think you can stay where you beat the Centurion and take pot shots at people, but the baddies right above will fire down on you, and some of the bigger baddies will come down the stairs after you, leaving you no place to run.

So go back down the hallway, if you're lucky you'll draw some fire.  When you get where you're under the bridge, snipe the guys taking shots at you.  Keep an eye on the stairs, if the Captain comes down, retreat further down the hallway until he goes back to the platform.  Continue to draw fire and snipe.  Once they're gone, head up and face the Captain.  Always have cover to cower behind.  

Phew!  I bet you're thinking after a fight like that, there would be a checkpoint right?  Right?!

**Nope**

## The Doorway
Pick a side, and start inching up to the doorway, as soon as you see a knight start sniping.  If you're lucky, you'll get it down before it fills the doorway with fire.  Well, honestly the doorway is STILL going to be get filled with fire since there's one on the other side as well.  But you'll feel better that you're half done.

While the Knights are filling the door with fire, start sniping everything else you can see.  The distant ones won't return fire, so it's pretty much a shooting gallery.  Feel free to cackle some more.

Now you actually do have to deal with the knights.  You might think it's a good idea to jump over the fire and engage, but that way lies madness and doing the whole first section of this again.  Try to stay wide and get as much of an angle as you can, but you might have to step in, shoot, then retreat.  If you're the impatient type, a carefully fired rocket can work here.

## The Passage
Now that you have a nice clear doorway, you can actually go through it and continue sniping everyone you see as you move along the passage.  Laughing manically the whole time.  Or until you run out of sniper ammo, then use your scout rifle.  Unless of course you ignored my advice and have a shotgun, in which case you deserve whatever death awaits you.

The short of it is, this part is easy if you just take your time and use your range to it's maximum advantage.

BTW, **still no checkpoint.**

## Rafters
*or beams, or balance beams, or @#$@ing balance beams, your preference really*

Go ahead and step on the beams and slowly go foward, until you hear spawning then...

**RETREAT RETREAT RETREAT**

As you look back, you'll see two Ogres have spawned.  But they are not just Ogres, they are Booping Ogres (genus Orgurs GodDammiturus). You should be back on solid ground now, so just ping them with your scout rifle.  For that guy with the shotgun, have fun with that.

As you go forward, you should always look to see which pillar is clear near you.  For every Ogre, there is a pillar you can hide behind before popping out and taking your shots.

### Question: You keep encouraging us to hide and cower and be cautious.  Are you just a freaking coward?
I'm alive aren't I?  Can't say the same for you, charging that Ogre and getting booped off the rafters for the 10th time.  It must be nice to have that much free time to run this section over and over.   Now kindly *shut up* so I can get this done.

Its important not to rush ANYTHING here.  You've done a lot of work, and falling off the rafters is just going to put you in a bad mood.

Once you make it to the end, I believe as soon as you cross the threshold to the shadow thralls you've reached a checkpoint.  I'd normally tell you to take a break here, but the shadow thrall area is so easy, you should be able to run through. The next area isn't worth talking about.  Just don't rush it and you'll be fine.  There aren't a lot of baddies, and you can finish off the yellow bar with a super.

No secrets, no swearing, its greasing you up for [Part 3 - Where you want to give up](./part3-ogre.html)
