# Part 2 - The Looooong Fight
Actually, what it should be called is *Please God Drop Some Sniper Ammo*, but that's a mouthful.

## STOP - Take a break!
Hopefully it's still Tuesday.  But after the last slog, you need to take a break for your mental health.  Especially since at this point you've been lulled into a false sense of security.  The last section was slow, but if done cautiously, not too bad.  So you might think it's going to be ok.  So let me reiterate.

**It is not going to be ok**

So take a break.  If you have time every day this week, you might just want to stop here for today.  But if not, you should probably try at least a couple runs of this next area after a nice relaxing nap.

Go ahead, I'll wait....

## Go time!
FYI, you snore.
