# Running the Shattered Throne....Solo
*A guide by an idiot, for other idiots that want to try this*

So you're at light level 650, you've forged everything, and you look around at what challenges could be left.  Paging through the triumphs, one just pops out at you, **solo-nely**, do the Shattered Throne solo.

You remember tackling this mission with a good team of three, there were challenges, but you overcame.  You might be an expert by now, able to run through the whole thing in under and hour.

So, it can't be that bad...could it?

Oh you complete idiot.  Yes.  Yes it could.  But if you want to proceed, I'm here to help.  One idiot to another.  This guide can be your light in the darkness, guiding your forward, helping you overcome the obstacles.  

This guide can give you hope.  Because I'm not an expert, you won't find any Twitch or YouTube streams where I show you how to finish a stage in less than a minute.  I'm just a regular player with average skill (though better than average looks).  So if you ever dispair, just think *"If an average guy did it, so can I!"*

But if you're looking for the place in this guide where I say *"It will all be ok"* stop looking.

Because it won't be ok.

Ever.

In fact, once you start down this road, it may never be ok again.

But that is the cost of delusional greatness.

If you're still willing to try, let's start with [What you need].(./what-you-need.html)
