# Running the Shattered Throne....Solo
*A guide by an idiot, for other idiots that want to try this*

So you're at light level 650, you've forged everything, and you look around at what challenges could be left.  Paging through the triumphs, one just pops out at you, **solo-nely**, do the Shattered Throne solo.

You remember tackling this mission with a good team of three, there were challenges, but you overcame.  You might be an expert by now, able to run through the whole thing in under and hour.

So, it can't be that bad...could it?

Oh you complete idiot.  Yes.  Yes it could.  But if you want to proceed, I'm here to help.  One idiot to another.  This guide can be your light in the darkness, guiding your forward, helping you overcome the obstacles.  

This guide can give you hope.  Because I'm not an expert, you won't find any Twitch or YouTube streams where I show you how to finish a stage in less than a minute.  I'm just a regular player with average skill (though better than average looks).  So if you ever dispair, just think *"If an average guy did it, so can I!"*

But if you're looking for the place in this guide where I say *"It will all be ok"* stop looking.

Because it won't be ok.

Ever.

In fact, once you start down this road, it may never be ok again.

But that is the cost of delusional greatness.

## What you need
Still with me? Good, here are things you're going to need:
* Whisper of the Worm - If you don't have it, then stop.  Just stop.  I did it without the catalyst, but **really** wish I had gotten it first.
* To have run this before as a fireteam.  This isn't a step by step walkthrough, I'm going to assume you know what the different encounters are, and how to traverse between them.
* Some Trandscendant Blessings and some armor you're willing to use it on.
* A set of void weapons you like.
* A knowledge of left vs right.
* A schedule that allows you to put in a couple of hours a day during Curse Week.  Trying to do this all at once is not good for your mental health.
* Someone who loves you nearby that will tell you it's all ok.  It's not, they're lying, but it's nice to hear.
* A space where you can curse.  Often and loudly.
* Snacks.  There will be stress eating.
* Your alchohol locked up.  Trust me on this, nothing good will come from having liquor handy here.
* Blessings of your priest, rabbi, imam, whatever.  Bonus points if you explain what its for.
