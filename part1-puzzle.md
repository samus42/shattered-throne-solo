# Part 1 - Puzzle Area
## STOP - Do this first!
Go to your roster, and set your fireteam to *closed*.  If you do not do this, each step forward you take adds a .5% chance that someone will join your fireteam to help you out and screw up your triumph.  This means by the time you get to the end boss it is a 1,000,000,000,000% chance.

## Loadout suggestions
Having long distance weapons is helpful here, the forge sniper rifle is incredibly nice here.  A scout rifle isn't bad either, but you won't get those distance one hit kills that are so satisfying.  You'll hit all the element shields in here, but it seems the last couple of captains are solar, so taking a solar heavy like Avalanche is a good idea.  I used Malfeasance as my primary as it gives bonus Taken damage, and when you run out of special/heavy, can do a decent job on the shields.

## Picking your subclass
Defense is what you're thinking here.  As a Hunter, Way of the Trapper gives you defensive tethers and the ability to disappear.  Warlocks should make use of their rifts, but if you're going to go for an offensive super, then use something you can hit with from a distance like Nova Bomb or Chaos Reach.  Using a well for pure defense isn't a bad choice either.  Titan, hammers are probably the way to go here, though a bubble Titan isn't terrible either.  You just lose the ability to kill while being inside.

## Making your way through the puzzle
You have a map right?  I mean you weren't dumb enough to come into this place without....fine, [here's a map]().  

There's going to be a couple of things happening that you might not have noticed too much when you were running with a fireteam.

First off, enemies are going to spawn in behind you, so turn your sound up and don't move forward to fast.  As soon as they spawn, turn around, should "I SEE YOU!" and wipe them out cackling gleefully.  Its really the only bit of pleasure you're going to get here.

Secondly, when you're gone past halfway through the stations, a bunch of snipers are going to show up to make your life miserable.  Kind of like when your in-laws show up unaccounced.  Take them seriously (the snipers, not the in-laws).

This part is mostly a slow slog.  Constructive cowardice is the name of the game here.   Before going into an area, think *where can I run away to*?  Sir Robin is your inspiration here.

Go forward slowly, and pick off as many as you can from a distance.  Take advantage of your sniper rifle and even take out enemies in areas you're not going to yet.  When you reach the Architect, no mercy, super the hell out of them.  But if you have to, take down the shield, do a couple hits of damage, then get out.  The best way to die here is to go toe to toe with the waves of darkness the Architect Captains will spam you with.

On a side note **@#$@ the captains**.

Finally, when crossing some of the bridges, you're going to get booped by a Centurion.  For those of you who don't know what booped is, it's a technical term:
```
booped: Getting knocked in the air when it is most inconvienent, and in a way to cause the most swearing.

ex. "Ace got booped off the ledge at the last stage of the raid boss causing us to fail the encounter for the 20th time in a row.  Ace was never heard from again"
```

Before crossing the bridge, look down.  There's usually some safe landing areas, you want keep as close to those as possible while crossing.  That way you can land safely, trek back up, yell "Surprise!" and waste the Centurion.  

I'm just kidding, he's going to boop you again.  Eventually he'll get bored and boop a Taken ant crawling around.  Use that opening to cross.  You can still yell "Surprise!" at that point I guess, but the moment has probably passed.

Once you've cleared the stations, drop down the hole and move forward until you get to the point where you drop down on the next set of enemies.

Or as I call it [Part 2 - The Loooooong Fight](./part2-long-fight.html)
